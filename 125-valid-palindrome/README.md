<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/">125. Valid Palindrome</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><div><p>A phrase is a <strong>palindrome</strong> if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.</p>

<p>Given a string <code>s</code>, return <code>true</code><em> if it is a <strong>palindrome</strong>, or </em><code>false</code><em> otherwise</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation:</strong> "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "race a car"
<strong>Output:</strong> false
<strong>Explanation:</strong> "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = " "
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation:</strong> s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 2 * 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>s</code> consists only of printable ASCII characters.</li>
</ul>

I had the pleasure of working with Azmat during my Software Developer Internship with our Performance Engineering Team. Azmat's mentorship cannot be explained in a general sense where a mentor tasks their mentee with the things that they are trying to team. Instead, Azmat really makes sure that his interns always feel like they belong in the team and that they feel less like "interns" and instead like full-fledged team members. He encourages his colleagues to be themselves both technically and professionally and this really brings out a different, more valuable, more irreplaceable asset out of the person. 

Throughout my time here, there hasn't been a single time when I have felt even remotely clueless, thanks to the excellent planning and leadership he portrays. The more I got to know him, the more I realized why he is extra-ordinary at what he does and so after shadowing him during my term, it has become a part of me to think outside the box, just as he does. 

Azmat is technically very creative and he has a vast range of expertise with different tech stacks - React, .NET 6, Tailwind CSS, Flowbite, and the list goes on. His toolkit is expansive within both backend and front-end making him an invaluable, key player in the important decisions we make for the team. I cannot emphasize how resourceful he has proven to be. Additionally, the amount of effort that went into the development and structuring of the codebase is highly commendable as it was very easy for me to pick it up and get started with my own development.

Furthermore, he is an exceptional mentor and a great planner as he did not leave any little details out when creating my roadmap for the internship while still maintaining a balance at giving me the liberty to pursue my own approaches and be myself. I cannot put into words how valuable the guide he created has been and I highly deem anyone who has him as his mentor to be very lucky indeed. 
he ensure onboarding guide was sound
